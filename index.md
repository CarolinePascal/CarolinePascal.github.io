## Biography 
Caroline Pascal is a PhD student in robotics and mechanics at U2IS and UME, ENSTA Paris. Despite her all-rounder personality, her focus is currently on the development of robotized solutions for the vibratory and acoustic characterization of unknown structures.
In this context, her work blends together various topics, including the modeling, calibration and control of robotic arms, and the development of innovative mechanical characterization methods, especially in acoustics.
Despite the research substance of any PhD thesis, a significant part of Caroline's work is dedicated to the development of generic and user-friendly ROS-based tools for a simplified sensor and tool integration on robotic arms.
